Build a complete, fully client-side productivity and study website using ONLY HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend, no server code, no Node.js, no React, no build tools). Everything must run 100% in the browser using localStorage, the Web Speech API, the Web Audio API, YouTube iframes, and pure client-side JavaScript. The site should have a clean, modern, Notion-like interface with a permanent left sidebar that dynamically switches between pages using SPA-style show/hide logic. Include the following sections: Dashboard, Study Techniques, Pomodoro Timer, Blurting Method (Audio Mode), AI Grading Tool, Flashcards, Daily Checklist, Habit Tracker, Productivity Graphs, Notes, Test Generator, Mind-Map Creator, Kanban Board, Calendar, Writing Dashboard, School Planner, Study Session Logger, Journal, and About. The Study Techniques page must include deep, detailed explanations for Pomodoro (with interval templates), Blurting (with sample “correct answers”), Active Recall (flashcard examples), Spaced Repetition (scheduling templates), the Feynman Technique (simplification examples), Interleaving (topic-mixing examples), Retrospective Timetabling, Cornell Notes (layout examples), Dual Coding (diagram examples), Mind-Mapping, PQ4R, SQ3R, retrieval warm-ups, and elaborative interrogation, including when to use each, step-by-step instructions, benefits, and common mistakes. The Pomodoro Timer must have customizable work/break durations, start/pause/reset buttons, animated progress indicators, and a field that takes a YouTube link and auto-embeds it for background ambience, tracking completed pomodoros in localStorage. The Blurting Tool must let users record audio with the Web Audio API, transcribe it with the Web Speech API, compare the transcript to user-provided notes, score accuracy, highlight missing concepts, and generate structured feedback. The AI Grading Tool must evaluate pasted writing using JavaScript heuristics (regex, keyword detection, pattern checking, readability formulas, vocabulary variety scoring, clarity and organization metrics) with NO external AI. Include Flashcards with create/edit/delete functions and a study mode; a Daily Checklist with points, rewards, and unlockables; a Habit Tracker with streaks and a Chart.js habit graph; Productivity Graphs displaying pomodoros, tasks, points, and habits over time; a Notes system with create/edit/search functionality; a Test Generator that turns user notes into multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer questions using client-side keyword extraction; a Mind-Map Creator with draggable nodes and connectable lines plus JSON export/import; a Kanban Board with draggable tasks; a Calendar system; a Writing Dashboard for drafts and writing tools; a School Planner for assignments, classes, and schedules; a Study Session Logger for tracking sessions; and a Journal with entries saved locally. Style everything with a clean modern theme, light/dark mode toggle, rounded cards, pastel accents, and smooth animations, ensuring full mobile responsiveness.
